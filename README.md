# Intersection
Intersection is a web-based simulation that allows users to manipulate the duration of traffic lights at an intersection. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is designed to showcase the developer's skills in front-end web development.

The simulation features three traffic lights - red, yellow, and green - that cycle through a predefined pattern. Users can adjust the duration of each light cycle by entering new values into input fields. 

Intersection is a simple yet effective demonstration of how JavaScript can be used to create dynamic and interactive user experiences on the web. It is ideal for developers who want to improve their skills in front-end web development and gain a deeper understanding of how JavaScript can be used to create interactive applications.
